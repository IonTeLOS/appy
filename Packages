Description: Lightweight, alternative Software Manager for modern Linux applications
 Appy provides a graphical user interface frontend for the flatpak and snap commands and a safe way to use the apt command. Appy can help you integrate AppImages into your System or build desktop web applications. Automatic updates is a built-in feature. Appy introduces the surf-to-get-app approach : Browse the web to find the flatpak or snap app you want and click on the "Install" button on flathub.org or snapcraft.io to make it happen ! Appy is written in bash script and uses yad dialog for GUI. Therefore, it has a low overhead using less RAM and processing power compared to your "other" Software Manager. This makes Appy suitable for less powerfull hardware and a fast tool to get the applications you want and easily manage them. A dedicated section of Appy - AppyHub - makes it easy to install several popular applications, including some non-free ones. This app has been developed and is being actively maintained by Ion @ TeLOS Linux (https://teloslinux.org). Appy has been created to become the default Software Manager in TeLOS Linux and is suitable for all Debian and Debian - based Linux distributions
